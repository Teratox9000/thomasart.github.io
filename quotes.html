        <div class="center-text">
            I wouldn't describe myself as a big arty person, but I learned that art is more than just the obvious contexts like paintings and music.
            Art is in every little thing. Anything can be art. Even people who don't describe themselves as artistic have a spark of art within them, in the form of thoughts, skills, and creativity.
